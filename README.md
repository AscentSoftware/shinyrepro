# shinyrepro

The aim of **shinyrepro** is to be able to recreate any output that is available in a Shiny application
outside of said application. 

In static documents, like Quarto, it is easy to include the code chunk by including code folding. 
Due to the interactiveness of Shiny, this isn't as easy to include out of the box. Reactive depend on
inputs set by the user, and need to be replaced in the reactive expressions to be able to run in an
environment outside of Shiny.



## Installation

To get the latest version of shinyrepro, install from GitHub:

```r
require(remotes)
remotes::install_github("AscentSoftware/shinyrepro")
```

## Usage

{shinyrepro} has one exported function, `repro()`, that takes a reactive object and converts it into a 
script that can be reused outside of the Shiny application to reproduce the result of the reactive. This
can be sent to a simple `verbatimTextOutput` or something more UX friendly such as the {highlighter}
package to display the script in the UI.

### Example

```r
library(shiny)
library(shinyrepro)

library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  h1("Reproducible Code Example"),
  inputPanel(
    sliderInput(
      "min_width",
      "Minimum Petal Width",
      min(iris$Petal.Width),
      max(iris$Petal.Width),
      min(iris$Petal.Width),
      step = 0.1
    ),
    selectInput(
      "summary_fn",
      "Summary Function",
      c("Mean" = "mean", "Median" = "median", "SD" = "sd"),
      selected = "mean"
    )
  ),
  fluidRow(
    column(
      width = 5,
      h2("Table"),
      tableOutput("table")
    ),
    column(
      width = 7,
      h2("Code"),
      verbatimTextOutput("code")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  iris_filt <- reactive({
    iris[with(iris, Petal.Width > input$min_width), ]
  })

  summary_tbl <- reactive({
    aggregate(
      Sepal.Width ~ Species,
      data = iris_filt(),
      FUN = get(input$summary_fn)
    )
  })

  output$table <- renderTable(summary_tbl())
  output$code <- renderText(repro(summary_tbl))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
